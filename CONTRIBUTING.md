## What should I know before I get started?

This repository is mainly the thoughtworks of the individual that owns this repository: [`@jesperorb`](https://github.com/jesperorb) and should not be treated as an official guide where _everything_ will be collected. The goal is to have _short_ sections for every part and just the _bare necessary_ parts. This means that the owner/owners of this repository, as it is now, will have final say on what's get added. **But don't get discouraged, the owner of this repository plans to collect all the contributions that didn't make the cut in an _appendix_. So contributions are very much welcomed, even if they don't make the cut they will still be saved.**
